## Overview

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) that replicates the classic Pong game with modern features and a robust backend architecture. It includes:

- **Secure Login**: User authentication and authorization for a personalized experience.
- **Tournament Management**: Organize and participate in tournaments with other players.
- **AI Opponent**: Play against an AI-powered opponent for solo gameplay.
- **Match History**: Track and review the history of all matches played.
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Tools like Grafana, Prometheus, and Alertmanager for real-time monitoring and alerting.
- **Centralized Logging**: An ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for managing and visualizing logs.
- **Reverse Proxy**: An nginx proxy server for secure routing and load balancing.

The application is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose, ensuring scalability, modularity, and ease of deployment.

## Services

### Proxy

The **Proxy** service acts as a reverse proxy and includes an API Gateway implemented within Nginx. It provides the following features:

- **Image**: proxy
- **Ports**: `8090:8090`
- **Healthcheck**: Ensures the proxy is running and accessible.
- **Dependencies**: Relies on backend services (e.g., authentication, tournament, history), monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus), and the ELK stack.

The Nginx configuration includes API Gateway functionality, making it a lightweight yet effective API Gateway. It handles:

- **Routing**: Directs API requests to appropriate backend services based on the URL path (`/api/user/` to `auth-service`, `/api/tournament/` to `tournament-service` and  `/api/history/` to `history-service`).
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements request rate limiting using the `api_limit` zone to prevent abuse.
- **Authentication**: Validates JWT tokens for protected routes and extracts user information for authenticated requests.
- **Security**: Adds standard proxy headers and enforces HTTPS with strong SSL/TLS configurations.
- **Static File Serving**: Serves the frontend static files, which are copied into the container during the Docker build process, ensuring efficient delivery of the application's static assets.

### Backend Services

1. **Auth Service**
   - **Description**: Handles user authentication and authorization, including secure login and OAuth integration.
   - **Framework**: Built with Django.
   - **Health Check**: Exposes health checks at `/watchman/?skip=watchman.checks.storage`.

2. **History Service**
   - **Description**: Manages the storage and retrieval of match history, allowing users to review past games.
   - **Framework**: Built with Django.
   - **Health Check**: Exposes health checks at `/watchman/`.

3. **Tournament Service**
   - **Description**: Provides functionality for creating, managing, and participating in tournaments.
   - **Framework**: Built with Django.
   - **Health Check**: Exposes health checks at `/watchman/`.

4. **Databases**
   - **Description**: Each backend service is paired with its own PostgreSQL database to ensure data isolation and scalability.
   - **Services**:
     - `auth_db`: Stores user authentication and authorization data.
     - `history_db`: Stores match history data.
     - `tournament_db`: Stores tournament-related data.

### Monitoring

1. **Grafana**
   - **Description**: A powerful visualization and monitoring dashboard that provides insights into system and application performance.
   - **Features**:
     - Two pre-configured dashboards:
       1. **Django Dashboard**: Allows switching between all microservices (e.g., `auth-service`, `history-service`, `tournament-service`) to monitor metrics like request rates, response times, and errors.
       2. **Node Exporter Dashboard**: Displays detailed system metrics, including CPU usage, RAM utilization, disk space, and network activity.
   - **Access**: Available at `https://localhost/grafana/`.

2. **Prometheus**
   - **Description**: A metrics collection and monitoring system that scrapes data from various services and evaluates alerting rules.
   - **Features**:
     - Collects metrics from all microservices, PostgreSQL databases, and the Nginx proxy.
     - Evaluates alerting rules defined in rules_1.yml, rules_2.yml, rules_3.yml, and rules_4.yml.
   - **Healthcheck**: Endpoint available at `http://localhost:9090/-/healthy`.

3. **Node Exporter**
   - **Description**: A lightweight exporter that collects system-level metrics from the host machine.
   - **Features**:
     - Provides data on CPU usage, memory availability, disk space, and network performance.
     - Integrated with the Node Exporter Dashboard in Grafana for detailed visualization.

4. **Alertmanager**
   - **Description**: Manages alerts generated by Prometheus and routes them to configured notification channels.
   - **Features**:
     - Sends alerts via email for critical issues, such as service downtime, high CPU usage, low disk space, or memory exhaustion.
     - Configured with alerting rules for all microservices and system metrics.

5. **Postgres Exporters**
   - **Description**: Specialized exporters that collect metrics from PostgreSQL databases.
   - **Features**:
     - Monitors database health, active connections, query performance, replication lag, and disk usage.
     - Metrics are visualized in Grafana and used for alerting in Prometheus.

### Alerts and Notifications

- **Alert Rules**: Defined in rules_1.yml, rules_2.yml, rules_3.yml, and rules_4.yml to monitor critical conditions across all services and infrastructure.
  - Examples:
    - **Instance Down**: Alerts when any service or exporter is unreachable.
    - **High CPU Load**: Triggers when CPU usage exceeds 80% for more than 5 minutes.
    - **Low Disk Space**: Alerts when disk space falls below 10%.
    - **PostgreSQL Issues**: Monitors database downtime, high connection counts, slow queries, and replication lag.
    - **Nginx Proxy Down**: Alerts if the Nginx proxy becomes unreachable.
- **Notification**: Alerts are sent via email to ensure timely responses to critical issues.

### ELK Stack

1. **Elasticsearch**
   - **Description**: A distributed search and analytics engine that serves as the centralized storage for logs and analytics.
   - **Features**:
     - Stores and indexes logs from various sources, including Nginx `access.log`.
     - Provides powerful search and aggregation capabilities for log analysis.
   - **Security**:
     - Fully secured with SSL and authentication.
     - Certificates for Elasticsearch are generated by a dedicated `setup` container, which creates all necessary certificates for Elasticsearch and Kibana.
     - Configured to use HTTPS for all communications, ensuring data integrity and privacy.
   - **Integration**: Works seamlessly with Logstash for log ingestion and Kibana for visualization.

2. **Logstash**
   - **Description**: A data processing pipeline that ingests, transforms, and forwards logs to Elasticsearch.
   - **Features**:
     - Parses Nginx `access.log` files and enriches the data for analysis.
     - Configured to securely communicate with Elasticsearch using SSL certificates generated by the `setup` container.
   - **Role in the Stack**:
     - Acts as the intermediary between Nginx logs and Elasticsearch, ensuring logs are properly formatted and indexed for analysis.

3. **Kibana**
   - **Description**: A visualization and exploration tool for Elasticsearch data.
   - **Features**:
     - Provides a pre-configured dashboard to analyze Nginx `access.log` data, including request rates, response statuses, client IPs, and more.
     - Allows users to query and visualize Elasticsearch data with ease.
   - **Access**: Available at `https://localhost/kibana`.
   - **Security**:
     - Uses SSL for secure communication with Elasticsearch.
     - Certificates for secure communication are generated by the `setup` container.

### Additional Notes

- **Setup Container**:
  - A dedicated container (`setup`) is responsible for generating all SSL certificates required by Elasticsearch and Kibana.
  - Ensures that all components of the ELK stack communicate securely using HTTPS.

- **Nginx Access Logs**:
  - The ELK stack is configured to parse and analyze Nginx `access.log` files.
  - Kibana's dashboard provides detailed insights into Nginx traffic, including request patterns, error rates, and client activity.

- **Secure Communication**:
  - All components of the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) are configured to use SSL for secure communication, ensuring data privacy and integrity.
